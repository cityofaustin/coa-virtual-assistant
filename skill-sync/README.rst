# Skill sync

In IBM Watson, 'Skills' are basically a set of intents and entities that are grouped
together into a 'thing' that your assistant can do.

The intent of skill-sync is to make sure that we can track changes and versions
here in this repo but also make sure changes made to the assistant are reflected
